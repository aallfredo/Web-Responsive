<h1>CSS files for styling</h1>

Here are the files responsible for the styling of your website. There are three files: style, style_ie7 and style_responsive.
You need to include all of them in your header. The file style_ie7 is for supporting the IE7 browser. All the barebones are made, so you only need to change the values with a text editor like Notepad++ or Atom (if you want the syntax colored).
